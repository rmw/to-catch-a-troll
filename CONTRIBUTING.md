## GitHub Workflow

* Create a branch for your feature
* Make a meaningful commit
* Write a commit message for each feature individually
* Use -v not -m to add commit messages
* When commiting a view, add a screenshot
* Use git pull --rebase origin master (this will bring in the updated master into your branch, so conflicts can be resolved beforing creating your pull request. Once conflicts are resolved, create a pull request on Github.)

## Team Workflow
* Standups every two hours
* Retro will occur at end of day
* Active Communication on Slack on what you are working on
* When working on a new task, make sure you move it from the 'Icebox' to the 'Current' list on Trello
* Smiles and high-fives!
